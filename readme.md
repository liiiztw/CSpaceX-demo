## Project Introduction

**CSpaceX** is a multiplayer online space strategy game where you start with a single planet and gradually build and manage your space empire.

### From One Planet to Galactic Dominance

At the start of the game, you own one planet as your base. You need to build metal mines, crystal mines, and deuterium synthesizers to gather resources, which are the foundation of development. As resources accumulate, you can upgrade buildings, research technologies, and build fleets. Each planet is an independent production base, and you can colonize more planets to expand your empire.

### Strategy and Wisdom Combined

The game is not just about building and collecting. You need to plan resource allocation, decide which technologies to prioritize, when to build fleets, and how to defend against enemies. The combat system tests your strategy—different warships have different characteristics and need to be properly combined to win. The expedition system brings unknown rewards and risks, and each exploration could change your fate.

### Interact with Players, Form Alliances

You can trade resources with other players, form alliances for joint operations, and compete for dominance in the galaxy. Alliance members can support each other and coordinate operations, making the game more social.

### Advanced Technology, Smooth Experience

The game is built with modern technology, featuring a smooth interface and simple operations. 3D visualization technology lets you see your planets and fleets intuitively. The system updates your resource production and construction progress in real-time, and the game continues to develop even when you're offline. All important operations have complete records, ensuring fairness and transparency.

### Continuous Development, Infinite Possibilities

The game world continues to operate, and your empire will keep growing. Every decision affects your development speed, and every battle could change the landscape. From one planet to galactic dominance, every step requires wisdom and strategy. Join CSpaceX, begin your interstellar journey, and write your legend in the vast universe!
